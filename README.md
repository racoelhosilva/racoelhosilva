<h3>Hi there! <span><img src="https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExd3YyaDc5cDh3dGtwMTM2Y2s2NmF1aWw0MzZtcHp3dGhjZGRpenJtcCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9cw/hMvfHRHC3f6sapMzrS/giphy.gif" width="20"></span></h3>

I'm **Rodrigo**, a computer science student between Lausanne ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ and Porto ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹.

I am currently a researcher at INESC-ID, where I help develop the analysis engine for the Glitch tool and define queries using Rego.

I am also pursuing a master's in Computer Science at EPFL (specializing in Foundations of Computing), after completing my bachelor's at FEUP.

I'm passionate about the theoretical foundations of computing (logic and algorithms) and understanding how clever solutions work under the hood. I also love coding and building projects that have practical applications.

Outside of work, I enjoy playing chess, reading books and playing video games.
