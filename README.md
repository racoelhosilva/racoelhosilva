<h3>Hi there! <span><img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZHBsamtnNmFhb2czdmVqdzd4Mnh3NTdzdGVhM2N5OWJjeWl5ZWUxMyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9cw/F9tGaJZqP4Dsw34rHb/giphy.gif" width="20"></span></h3>

I'm **Rodrigo**, a computer science graduate between Lausanne ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ and Porto ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹.

I am currently a researcher at INESC-ID, where I help develop the analysis engine for the Glitch tool and define queries using Rego. I am also pursuing a master's in Computer Science at EPFL, after completing my bachelor's at FEUP.

I'm passionate about the theoretical foundations of computing (math, logic and algorithms) and understanding how clever solutions work under the hood. I also love coding, experimenting with different technologies and building projects that have practical applications.

<h4>Outside of work, I enjoy:</h4>

ðŸ§© playing chess and video games  
ðŸ“œ reading books (*Fellowship of the Ring* by J.R.R. Tolkien)  
ðŸª´ learning new things, inside and outside computer science
