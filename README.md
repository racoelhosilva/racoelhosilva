<h3>Hi there! ðŸ‘‹</h3>

I'm **Rodrigo**, a computer science graduate between Lausanne ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ and Porto ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹.

I am currently a researcher at [@INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt), where I help develop the analysis engine for the [Glitch](https://github.com/sr-lab/glitch) tool and define queries using Rego. I am also pursuing a master's in Computer Science at [@EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/computer-science), after completing my bachelor's at FEUP.

I'm passionate about the theoretical foundations of computing (math, logic and algorithms) and understanding how clever solutions work under the hood. I also love coding, experimenting with different technologies and building projects that have practical applications.

<h5>Outside of work, I enjoy:</h5>

ðŸ§© playing chess and indie video games  
ðŸ“œ reading books â†’ *The Fellowship of the Ring* <sub>by **J.R.R Tolkien**</sub>  
ðŸª´ learning things I didn't know I didn't know
