<h3>Hi there! <span><img src="https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZHBsamtnNmFhb2czdmVqdzd4Mnh3NTdzdGVhM2N5OWJjeWl5ZWUxMyZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9cw/F9tGaJZqP4Dsw34rHb/giphy.gif" width="20" alt="ðŸ‘‹"></span></h3>

I'm **Rodrigo**, a computer science graduate between Lausanne ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ and Porto ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹.

I am currently a researcher at [@INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt), where I help develop the analysis engine for the [Glitch](https://github.com/sr-lab/glitch) tool and define queries using Rego. I am also pursuing a master's in Computer Science at [@EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/education/master/programs/computer-science), after completing my bachelor's at FEUP.

I'm passionate about the theoretical foundations of computing (math, logic and algorithms) and understanding how clever solutions work under the hood. I also love coding, experimenting with different technologies and building projects that have practical applications.

<h5>Outside of work, I enjoy:</h5>

ðŸ§© playing chess and video games  
ðŸ“œ reading books (*Fellowship of the Ring* by J.R.R. Tolkien)  
ðŸª´ learning new things, inside and outside computer science
